Using AIMS to Analyze Immune Repertoires
===================================

The primary goal of AIMS is to identify discriminating factors between two distinct sets of immune molecules. Currently the software can be applied to immunoglobulin (Ig) molecules such as T cell receptors and antibodies, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and MHC-like molecules, and immunopeptidomic data.

AIMS is a python package distributed in both a notebook and GUI format. Those wishing to use the GUI, particularly those relatively new to programming, can follow the installation instructions below. Example data is provided in AIMS/app/ab_testData and AIMS/app/mhc_testData, and an example of an application of AIMS can be seen in this peer-reviewed article: https://elifesciences.org/articles/61393

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
